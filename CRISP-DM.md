As a data analyst, you will face a multitude of challenges ranging from understanding various business problems to choosing the best techniques to solve them. To avoid getting lost, data scientists have developed a robust process to solve virtually any analytics problem in any industry–appropriately called the **Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP–DM)** framework.

 

It involves a series of steps which contains following steps:

* Business understanding
* Data understanding
* Data Preparation
* Data Modelling
* Model Evaluation
* Model Deployment
 
 We now have a framework to think about complex problems, but where do we start from? Do we ask for data straightaway? Or do we ask some fundamental questions to understand the problem better?

 

Imagine you are driving to a hill station and your car broke down in the middle of nowhere. You have a toolkit and you want to repair the car. To do so, you need to know exactly what has gone wrong. Is it the engine, the battery or you simply ran out of fuel?  

 

For a data analyst, understanding the business and its specific problems is of utmost importance. You ought to understand the problem clearly to convert it into a well-defined analytics problem. Only then you can lay out a brilliant strategy to solve it, else you'll be super efficient in solving the wrong problem!

 

After figuring out the problem with the car, you ideally experiment with various tools and follow a somewhat sequential procedure, like a good mechanic.  Similarly, analytics projects have a typical life-cycle with the six stages of the CRISP-DM framework.

**NOTE:-**It is important to note that steps in CRISP-DM framework are not necessarily sequential in nature. For example, your data understanding can improve your understanding of business itself. But it all starts with business understanding. We should be able to articulate the business objectives from the broad problem statement so that the next steps in the CRISP-DM framework can be performed effectively. 

 

**In summary, to understand the business problem, one has to undertake the following steps of analyses:** 

* Determine the business objectives clearly
* Determine the goals of data analysis 


# Understanding Raw Data 

**"Data! Data! Data! I can’t make bricks without clay!"**
 

After business understanding, the next step is data understanding. Once you get your hands on the data for the first time, you would want to know its structure (number of files, rows, columns etc.), understand how they are related to each other and whether something looks fishy–like a date column having negative values. Broadly, you are interested in:  

* The type of data sets that are available for analysis
* The information you can get from the datasets
* Exploring the data (by plotting graphs and observing them)
* Performing quality checks on the data sets etc.

Data Understanding comprised of following steps :-
* Collection of relevant data
* Description of the available data
* Exploration of the data
* Verifying the data quality for removing the errors.
