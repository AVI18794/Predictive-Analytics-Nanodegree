As a data analyst, you will face a multitude of challenges ranging from understanding various business problems to choosing the best techniques to solve them. To avoid getting lost, data scientists have developed a robust process to solve virtually any analytics problem in any industry–appropriately called the **Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP–DM)** framework.

 

It involves a series of steps which contains following steps:

* Business understanding
* Data understanding
* Data Preparation
* Data Modelling
* Model Evaluation
* Model Deployment
 
 We now have a framework to think about complex problems, but where do we start from? Do we ask for data straightaway? Or do we ask some fundamental questions to understand the problem better?

 

Imagine you are driving to a hill station and your car broke down in the middle of nowhere. You have a toolkit and you want to repair the car. To do so, you need to know exactly what has gone wrong. Is it the engine, the battery or you simply ran out of fuel?  

 

For a data analyst, understanding the business and its specific problems is of utmost importance. You ought to understand the problem clearly to convert it into a well-defined analytics problem. Only then you can lay out a brilliant strategy to solve it, else you'll be super efficient in solving the wrong problem!

 

After figuring out the problem with the car, you ideally experiment with various tools and follow a somewhat sequential procedure, like a good mechanic.  Similarly, analytics projects have a typical life-cycle with the six stages of the CRISP-DM framework.

**NOTE:-**It is important to note that steps in CRISP-DM framework are not necessarily sequential in nature. For example, your data understanding can improve your understanding of business itself. But it all starts with business understanding. We should be able to articulate the business objectives from the broad problem statement so that the next steps in the CRISP-DM framework can be performed effectively. 

 

**In summary, to understand the business problem, one has to undertake the following steps of analyses:** 

* Determine the business objectives clearly
* Determine the goals of data analysis 


# Understanding Raw Data 

**"Data! Data! Data! I can’t make bricks without clay!"**
 

After business understanding, the next step is data understanding. Once you get your hands on the data for the first time, you would want to know its structure (number of files, rows, columns etc.), understand how they are related to each other and whether something looks fishy–like a date column having negative values. Broadly, you are interested in:  

* The type of data sets that are available for analysis
* The information you can get from the datasets
* Exploring the data (by plotting graphs and observing them)
* Performing quality checks on the data sets etc.

Data Understanding comprised of following steps :-
* Collection of relevant data
* Description of the available data
* Exploration of the data by plotting various graphs.
* Verifying the data quality for removing the errors.


# Prepararing Data for Analysis
**"Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe."**
Across projects, data analysts spend around 50-80% of the time on data cleaning and preparation, and therefore data preparation becomes one of the most crucial steps.

 

Data is usually spread across different files. Collating those files together and selecting the required rows and columns based on business understanding is a major step in data preparation. After collating the data set we address missing values and outliers. It is considered the most crucial step because the model will be built on the data sets created here. 

 

If the data set is erroneous, the solution to the problem we get after building a model would be erroneous too-no matter how the model is being created.
To summarise, data preparation is one of the most time-consuming steps of the entire analysis. It consists of the following steps:

* Select relevant data
* Integrate data
* Clean data(Handle error,missing values and other discrepancies present in the dataset)
* Construct Data: Derive new features
* Format Data

# Modelling 
**"If you torture the data long enough, it will confess."**
Modelling is the heart of data analytics. One can think of a model as a black box which takes relevant data as input and gives an output you are interested in.

# Model Evaluation and Deployment
** "True genius resides in the capacity for evaluation of uncertain, hazardous and conflicting information."**
In data analytics, evaluation is when you put everything you have done to litmus tests. If the results obtained from model evaluation are not satisfactory, you reiterate the whole process. If the model performs well and gives you accurate results, congratulations. You can move on to implementation of the model. 

Evaluation is necessary to ensure that your model is **robust** and **effective**. Finally, implementation is the natural fruition of a project life-cycle.

 

One interesting insight is that the **whole process is iterative in nature**. The intelligence of a model has to evolve continuously.
