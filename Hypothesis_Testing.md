# Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is used to confirm your conclusion (or hypothesis) about the population parameter (which you know from EDA or your intuition). Through hypothesis testing, you can determine whether there is enough evidence to conclude if the hypothesis about the population parameter is true or not.Hypothesis is of two types:-

1) Null Hypothesis :- H<sub>0</sub>:- The null hypothesis is the prevailing belief about the population.It states that there is no change or no difference in the situation.It assumes that the status quo is true.

2) Alternate/Research  Hypothesis :- H<sub>1</sub>:- It is a claim that opposes the null hypothesis.

In other words,Hypothesis Testing starts with the formulation of these two hypotheses:

Null hypothesis (H₀): The status quo

Alternate hypothesis (H₁): The challenge to the status quo

The formulation of the null and alternate hypotheses determines the type of the test and the position of the critical regions in the normal distribution.

 

You can tell the type of the test and the position of the critical region on the basis of the ‘sign’ in the alternate hypothesis.

      

       ≠ in H₁    →   Two-tailed test        →     Rejection region on both sides of distribution

       < in H₁    →   Lower-tailed test     →     Rejection region on left side of distribution

       > in H₁    →   Upper-tailed test     →     Rejection region on right side of distribution

# Types of Tests
1) Two Tailed Tests
2) One Tailed Tests

# Decision Making
1) Critical Value Method
2) P-Value Method
